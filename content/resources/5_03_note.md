description: This file is an annotated version of class notes "Accelerated Molecular
  Dynamics, Kinetic Monte Carlo, and Inhomogeneous Spatial Coarse Graining" and explains
  coarse-graining, renormalized potentials, problems of time and space, evaluation
  criteria and problems with dynamics in coarse-grained models, parallel replica method,
  temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD), kinetic Monte Carlo, and dilute diffusion
  theory.
