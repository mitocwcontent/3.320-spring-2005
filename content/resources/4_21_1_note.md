description: This file is an annotated version of class notes "Model Hamiltonions"
  and explains realistic descriptions of large-scale nanostructures from first-principles
  and mapping electronic structure-calculations into model Hamiltonians (Ising-like
  models for alloys and tight-binding orbitals for functionalized nanotubes).
